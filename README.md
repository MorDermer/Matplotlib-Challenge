3) Capomulin treatment of mouse l509-on day number 20 the tumors value was the highes and then it started to decrease. 
4) The correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.84. It is a strong positive correlation, when the mouse weight increases the average tumor volume also increases.
